# Beauty Salon
This application developed in Java represents working with Beauty Salon.

## Implementation
The application has very simple GUI which was made using Java SWING.
There are 4 types of users: Manager, Cosmetician, Receptionist and Client. Each of them can log into their account and use allowed features.
I used XChart to make graphs for statistics and other jars like JCalendar to make datetime pickers.
Data is stored in CSV files.
